# Virtual Folders

Organize your projects and files the way you want, directly inside [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus).

This plugin adds a dockable tree panel where you can create your own virtual folder structure. Group files from different paths, reorder them freely, and keep related resources together without touching the actual filesystem.

# Features

Dockable tree panel with customizable layout

Create and manage virtual folders

Add files from anywhere on your system

Reorder and group items independent of the OS

Quick navigation and context menu actions

# Why this plugin?
Working with many scattered files in Notepad++ was frustrating. I wanted a simple way to arrange them logically without moving them on disk. Building this plugin was a long, stubborn effort—fighting Win32 quirks, Notepad++ internals, and my own persistence. But the result is a tool I personally needed, and I hope it helps others too.

— Developed with patience (and coffee).


# Installation
Just unpack the VirtualFolder zip-archive (the last *dll*.zip under https://github.com/FatihC/VirtualFolders/releases ) to the folder "Notepad++\plugins". It will extract the file "VirtualFolders.dll" as well as the "localization" subfolder.
