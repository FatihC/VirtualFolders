# Translations

If you want to add a translation for your preffered language you don't need to modify any source code. All you need is to create a copy of localization/english.xml file and replace texts there. Just make sure you save that file with the same name in Notepad++ localization folder: `%%Notepad++ Installation Folder%%\localization`\
For example: if you want to add a translation for Brazilian Portuguese language you would create a file named brazilian_portuguese.xml with all texts translated.

And if you create a Pull Request with that xml file your language would be added.
